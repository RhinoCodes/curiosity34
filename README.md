# Curiosity34

This keyboard is inspired by the reviung 34 by @gtips. In fact, it uses the exact same layout. The main features of this board are:
* Integrated
* USB-C Through C3 Daughterboard

A GB will be running with this design and a custom milled POM case in colaboration with Glow#2411 on Discord.
